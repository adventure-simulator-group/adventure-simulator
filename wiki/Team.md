# Adler Halbe - Project Director
## When to consult
* Big-picture question about the project
* When you have any question that you aren't sure how to find the answer to. I may not know it myself, but I almost always can figure out where to look or who to ask
* When you need a rubber duck
## Skills
* Very comfortable in Rust
* Has a jack-of-all-trades, master of none understanding of almost every individual component of gamedev (like what does a UV map do, what differentiates deferred rendering from forward/forward+, how does one serialize state, difference between using input directly and events, etc)
* Great at webdev
* People-person, at least by programmer standards...
