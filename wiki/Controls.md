## Direct
* Left stick/WASD move
* Right stick/mouse to look
* Release Space/LT - dodge/jump
	* A quick tap is more like a hop or a dash. Holding for a bit before releasing makes it a full-body jump
* Shift/partial-LT - crouch/duck
	* When crouching and attacked, your character automatically ducks in an appropriate direction
* Ctrl/L - prone/stand up
	* Jump while held to dive
	* Crouch/duck to orient yourself in the direction that the camera is facing
	* Once prone/supine, jump causes you to roll if in a lateral direction, scamper otherwise. This is a very mediocre dodge
	* When prone, your character automatically switches to supine based on how you look around. Like if you're looking forward you're prone, if you look in the direction of your toes now you're supine
## Indirect
* You can relinquish detailed control of your character to an AI and direct them with RTS-like controls
* The purpose of this is in case you need to walk somewhere that will be tedious or you just don't like action games
	* Could also support actually controlling multiple characters in the future
* The same system used to direct your character should share most functionality with how NPCs are controlled anyways
* This doesn't have to work especially well on a controller, mainly for mouse and keyboard
* RMB - move to
	* While in combat your character should attack enemies in range of their own volition, so moving to an enemy is just attacking them in melee
* LMB - select
	* Hold to box select
	* Basically irrelevant if you only control one character...
* MMB - hold to rotate camera
* WASD - pan camera
