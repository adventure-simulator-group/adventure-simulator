# Adventure Simulator (working title)
## Pitch
Adventure Simulator is a web-first pseudo-MMO. The golden age of web games had a number of pseudo-MMO games like Neopets or Club Penguin (and actual MMOs, such as Runescape) that have since largely had their markets captured by mobile games and native desktop games. But WASM and WebGPU have opened up a new opportunity to create a kind of web-first game that has not really been possible to do until recently, with near-feature and performance parity with native applications.

Our goal is to create a unified, massively-multiplayer world that sidesteps the nightmarish networking challenge of a unified world server by having its "world" be structured as a database with an asynchronous AJAX interface, then instancing individual parties on their own virtual servers whenever they engage enemies in real-time combat.

Player characters spend downtime, purchase [equipment](Inventory), join parties, and embark on [quests](Quests) from [settlements](Settlement), which also serve as a bulletin-board-like social hub. Then, in the course of the quests they've undertaken, load into the real-time WebGPU-rendered combat simulation when their party arrives at their destination or is randomly attacked along the way.

On a gameplay-level, the nearest games for inspiration are Mount and Blade, Battle Brothers, Starsector, and (to some extent) Kenshi. Like the former three, the world is separated between the "tactical" layer and the "strategic" layer. In Adventure Simulator, the tactical layer is a real-time simulation, while the strategic one advances is in discrete chunks of time (essentially, fast travel/resting). But it features the same basic formula of recruiting a party to adventure with, defeating enemies in randomly generated missions, then using your hard-earned rewards to buy equipment.

Players can also control multiple [characters](Character), which can be either mortal or immortal. Mortal characters offer a more roguelike/extraction-esque experience, with fast progression and frequent deaths. When a mortal character dies, any wealth not on their person will be inherited by your other characters. Immortal characters offer a more conventional RPG/MMO-experience, which emulates the cost of mortal characters with costly respawns and slow [healing](Health).
## Setting
The world of Adventure Simulator is a fantastical version of Earth. Warhammer Fantasy players or readers of pre-Tolkien fantasy will be familiar with the idea, but essentially the setting is fundamentally based on historical renaissance Earth (approximately ~1543) with generic fantasy elements inexplicably sprinkled throughout.

The heuristic here is to place fantasy elements in places that don't fundamentally alter historical conditions too much. Elves generally keep to forests or fictional islands, Dwarves dwell within mountains, and creatures like orcs, goblins, beastmen, and the undead either roam as hordes or occupy fictional caves or forgotten underworld crypts. To the extent that the kingdoms of men *interact* with these fantastical elements is generally in hiring heroes to deal with the nuisances caused by hostile fantasy creatures. Elves and Dwarves are uninterested in human political squabbles over borders and wars of succession, and fantastical enemies never really pose a strategic threat to human kingdoms, so the historical and fantastical elements of the setting can generally avoid stepping on each others' toes.

To start, the playable section of Earth will be limited to Italy. But in the long term, we will gradually expand to all of Europe and beyond.

## Open-source
Adventure Simulator is designed not *only* to facilitate a fantasy game, but its open source nature means that, once it has tools to enable this, modders can come in and take it in all sorts of unexpected directions in the future. They could do total conversions to other fantasy settings, sci-fi, or... [something else](https://fxtwitter.com/warlockracy/status/1489001741337169926).
