Characters are created by investing some amount of [favor](Magic) into them. The more powerful the character, as determined by their [stats](Stats), the more favor you need to invest. The exact kind of favor you need also depends on what character you want. If you want an elf character, you need to go do some quests with the elves.

You aren't exactly spawning a character into the world, per-se, but rather obtaining control over a character that ostensibly already exists. The consequence of this is that you don't necessarily have to start "fresh" with a young, untrained character that has no background. You can also immediately create a wealthy, skilled character simply by spending a lot of favor on them.
## Mortal
Mortal characters age normally and cannot normally have their physical features customized (you have to choose from a limited selection of randomly generated characters). They are cheap and efficient, ideal for players that want more of a rogue-like/extraction experience of frequently rolling new characters, quickly obtaining power, dying, and starting over.
### Humans
Default
### Dwarves
No different than their Tolkien/Warhammer depiction. They are proud, stubborn, greedy, ~~short~~ sturdy, and strong. Dwarves dwell in underground mountain cities and in their days of glory built extensive tunnel networks between them, which have since been infested by foul creatures.

Dwarves which shame their kin by dishonoring the ancestors, breaking oaths, or engaging with prissy Elven nonsense like magic may be exiled, at best, or at worst, compelled to redeem their honor by undertaking various suicide missions to retake an ancestral realm.

They will not actually be included in the [MVP](Roadmap) and tentatively not the next phase either due to the need to make lots of Dwarf-specific assets. But there is ostensibly a big Dwarf kingdom up in the Alps and a smaller one in the Alpennine. 
### Halflings/Hobbits
No different than their Tolkien/Warhammer depiction. They are a small, jovial, provincial people generally unconcerned with the matters of the "big people". Would be found in small idyllic villages here and there, but not important enough to put in the MVP.
### Orcs/Goblins
Basically less-comedic Warhammer greenskins, except they specifically can only be grown from nasty underground funky pools. An Orc is just a Goblin who had lots of fresh meat thrown into its spawning pool (and must maintain this diet). 

If you aren't familiar with Warhammer, the idea is that they are a fungus-based lifeform with genetic memories. The *point* is for them to not need a complex civilization to be threatening (they already *know* how to fight and speak) and for you to not feel bad for slaughtering them (no women or children, they emerge REDY 2 FITE).
### Ratlings
Warhammer Fantasy Skaven, except with the technology level toned down somewhat. These are wretched, craven humanoid rats that dwell underground, both in stolen Dwarven cities as well as their own subterranean creations beneath prosperous human cities.

They don't need to be included in the MVP.
## Immortal
An immortal character is one who not only does not biologically age, but will respawn if killed and can also be customized in detail. The purpose is to give players the option for a more conventional RPG playstyle, as opposed to the more punishing roguelike/extraction-ish style of using mortal characters. Everyone's first character (and probably the next several) will be mortal, however, because mortal characters are playable on free accounts and your first can be obtained with zero [favor](Magic). 

However, immortality is defined based on the race, not just an abstract per-character flag. In the current iteration of the [roadmap](Roadmap), the only planned immortal race are elves.

When you customize a new immortal character, you are ostensibly not actually *creating* a new character. You're just being particular about which, already existing, character you want to take control of. This doesn't mean anything gameplay-wise, you still customize a character, but it explains where they come from (they were ostensibly an NPC which existed in the world before you took control of them).

The cost of losing a very valuable mortal character is made equivalent for immortal characters by levying a commensurate [favor](Magic) cost to respawn them. It may even be *more* inefficient in the case of immortal characters, so don't use them for suicide missions. But what they lack in efficiency they make up for in having a higher effective skill ceiling due to having unlimited time to train [skills](Stats) (albeit with dramatically decreasing rate of return).

All immortal races are said to have "Fey-blood".
### Elves
No different than their Tolkien/Warhammer depiction. Tall, beautiful, and haughty, they live either in deep forests or fictitious islands. Are generally morally good, but may also be evil "Dark Elves" or somewhat more neutral eco-terrorist "Wood Elves".
### Dragons
Intelligent dragons who can take on a human form. Would be extraordinarily expensive to actually create a full-blooded dragon character. Some dragons may be unable or unwilling to take a human form. Absolutely not in the MVP and almost certainly not in the polished product unless one of the devs is very insistent.

> Halbe: *I* certainly am not going to try and animate dragon flight
### Beastmen 
(rename "Beastlings"? "Shifters"?)
Have both a beast form and human form that they can shift between. The exact type of beast depends on whatever would be local to them. Can be felines, canines, serpentines, equestrians, lizards, and more.

Probably not in the MVP, might be in the polished product at least for wolves.

## Half/quarter/etc-blooded
These generally look like normal humans except they can be immortal and customized. The point is if you want the mechanics of an elf/dragon/beasts/etc but don't want the pointy ears/form changing. These come from breeding between mundane and fey-blooded people.

In the case of fey-bloods that can shift between forms, the half-bloods may not be able to shift and instead take on some intermediate characteristics of the two forms.

> Halbe: Yes, half-blooded beastmen are the "designated furry race". And I think gnomes are just elf-hobbit hybrids
## Vilebloods
When a mundane character consumes fey blood you can *become* fey-blooded. However, this is evil, so it also curses you. The exact nature of the curse depends on the kind of fey-blood.
* Werewolves/bears/etc are beastmen-blooded
* True Vampires are elf-blooded
	* Mostly analogous to Warhammer Dark Elves. Do not burn in the sun, are not actually undead.
* The aesthetic of "freaky devil-looking things" like an imp is captured by mongrel vilebloods that may take features from a mix of reptilian/mammalian/draconic/elven blood.
## Undead
* Risen from the dead through unnatural magic.
* Vampires are created by other vampires who offer mortals their blood and bury them alive, after they suffocate to death they become vampires.
* Zombies and skeletons do not have elf-blood, but are risen via necromancy. These are mindless and must be consciously puppeted by a necromancer.
* Ghouls/wights are zombies/skeletons that have a soul bound to them (ritual requires elf-blood). They are not mindless and although bound to a necromancer, can act autonomously.
* A lich is a necromancer that turns themself into a wight. Since their soul is bound to themself, they are the only type of wight with free will. This also implies the possibility of ghoul-liches, who retain their flesh.
