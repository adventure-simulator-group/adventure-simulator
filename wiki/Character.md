* Characters are created by investing some amount of favor into them.
* The more powerful the character, the more favor you need to invest.
* The exact kind of favor you need also depends on what character you want. If you want an elf character, you need to go do some quests with the elves.
* You aren't exactly spawning a character into the world, per-se, but rather obtaining control over a character that ostensibly already exists.
	* To the extent that you can customize them, you are simply being particular about which, existing, character you want to take control of.
	* This doesn't mean you are necessarily picking from a selection, but that's supposedly what happens behind the scenes
	* The consequence of this is that you don't necessarily have to start "fresh" with a young, untrained character that has no background. You can also immediately create a wealthy, skilled character simply by spending a lot of favor on them.
## Mundane
* Mundane characters age normally and cannot normally have their physical features customized (you have to choose from a limited selection).
* They are cheap and efficient, ideal for players that want more of a rogue-like/extraction experience of frequently rolling new characters, quickly obtaining power, dying, and starting over.
### Humans
Default
### Dwarves
* No different than their Tolkien/Warhammer depiction
* Dwell in underground mountain cities, greedy, enjoy digging, unbelievably racist and prideful
### Halflings/Hobbits
No different than their Tolkien/Warhammer depiction
### Orcs/Goblins
* Basically less-comedic Warhammer greenskins, except they specifically can only be grown from nasty underground funky pools.
* You do not need to glass the surface of a planet to get rid of them, just light their spawning pool on fire.
* If you aren't familiar, the idea is that they are a fungus-based lifeform with genetic memories.
* The point is for them to not need a complex civilization to be threatening (they already *know* how to fight and speak) and for you to not feel bad for slaughtering them (no women or children, they emerge REDY 2 FITE)
### Ratlings
* Warhammer Fantasy Skaven, except with the technology level toned down somewhat
* Wretched, craven humanoid rats that dwell underground
* They build underneath cities and steal food from their unaware hosts
## Fey-blooded
* Fey-blooded characters do not normally age, can be customized to your liking, and may even have the ability to respawn or otherwise cheat death.
* They are very expensive to create (and to respawn), making them ideal for players who want to create a specific character to their liking and not have their progress frequently set back by deaths.
* Their biological traits generally make the game less punishing.
	* For example, they pass out quickly from blood loss, but form scar tissue extremely quickly meaning that slight injuries will incapacitate them but rarely result in death
	* They [convalesce](Health) very quickly
	* Most of their physical [attributes](Stats) are very high, with the exception of gut which is extremely low
* They are essentially incarnated from the spirit world, usually to help humans in the war against evil.
### Elves
No different than their Tolkien/Warhammer depiction
### Dragons
Intelligent dragons who can take on a human form. Extraordinarily expensive to actually create a full-blooded dragon character. Some dragons may be unable or unwilling to take a human form.
### Beastmen
Have both a beast form and human form that they can shift between. The exact type of beast depends on whatever would be local to them. Can be felines, canines, serpentines, equestrians, lizards, and more.

## Half/quarter/etc-blooded
* Generally look like normal humans except they can be immortal and customized.
* Its if you want the mechanics of an elf/dragon/beasts/etc but don't want the pointy ears/dragon form/beast form.
* These come from breeding between mundane and fey-blooded people.
* In the case of fey-bloods that can shift between forms, the half-bloods may not be able to shift and instead take on some intermediate characteristics of the two forms.
	* Yes, half-blooded beastmen are the "designated furry race"
* I think gnomes are just elf-hobbit hybrids
## Vilebloods
* When a mundane character consumes fey blood you can *become* fey-blooded.
* This is evil, which also curses you.
* The exact nature of the curse depends on the kind of fey-blood.
	* Werewolves/bears/etc are beastmen-blooded
	* True Vampires are elf-blooded
		* Mostly analogous to Warhammer Dark Elves. Do not burn in the sun, are not actually undead.
	* The aesthetic of "freaky devil-looking things" like an imp is captured by mongrel vilebloods that may take features from a mix of reptilian/mammalian/draconic/elven blood.
## Undead
* Risen from the dead
* Vampires are created by true/undead vampires who offer mortals their blood and bury them alive, after they suffocate to death they become vampires
* Zombies and skeletons do not have elf-blood, but are risen via necromancy. These are mindless and must be consciously puppeted by a necromancer.
* Ghouls/wights are zombies/skeletons that have a soul bound to them (ritual requires elf-blood). They are not mindless and although bound to a necromancer, can act autonomously.
* A lich is a necromancer that turns themself into a wight. Since their soul is bound to themself, they are the only type of wight with free will. This also implies the possibility of ghoul-liches, who retain their flesh.
